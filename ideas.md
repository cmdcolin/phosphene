Remaining ideas from the list when you want them: the video-synth oscillator
source, chroma key, and the audio-reactive path.

## Capture / deinterlace (grown out of the RCA-input work)

- **Motion-adaptive deinterlace.** Current `deint` is an unconditional
  even-field bob — halves vertical resolution even on still frames. Weave where
  fields match (full res on static areas) and bob only where they differ (a
  per-pixel inter-field delta metric); keeps sharpness off motion.
- **Deint modes instead of on/off.** Turn the toggle into a mode select: off /
  bob (current) / blend (average both fields — ghosts on motion, keeps res) /
  weave. Blend is cheaper and some people prefer its look.
- **Auto-detect interlacing.** Measure a comb metric on the incoming source and
  flip `deint` on automatically only for genuinely-interlaced feeds, instead of
  hard-enabling it on every webcam/USB connect (progressive USB cams get
  needlessly softened today).
- **Remember the last capture device.** Persist the chosen `deviceId` so a
  reconnect re-selects the dongle rather than the OS default camera.
- **PAL capture.** Composite grabbers also deliver 720×576/50i; the pipeline is
  NTSC-shaped (525/60). At minimum square-pixel it correctly; ideally note the
  standard mismatch in the UI.

## Deflection (follow-ons to the sync/bend work)

- **Intra-line geometry.** `hSize`, `hLin` (S-correction failure stretching one
  side), pincushion. Blocked on decode's tiling: the workgroup stages one
  contiguous 128-sample span per row, so only _row-uniform_ horizontal offsets
  are free. Non-uniform scaling within a line reads outside the halo.
- **Vertical geometry.** `vSize` / `vLin` are nearly free by contrast — they
  only change which source row a screen row picks.
- **Fractional bend.** `hoff` is `round()`ed to whole samples; at large
  amplitudes adjacent rows stair-step. Resampling the tile with `catmull` would
  smooth it, at the cost of restructuring the staging.
- **Neon phosphor colour.** Planned in detail in `docs/phosphor-plan.md`.

## Screen-domain effects not yet built

- ~~**Halation**~~ — done. `crt_face` already adds a wide warm glass-scatter
  halo (`crtHalation` × the 15-px golden-angle tap ring, tinted `WARM`), and the
  slider is live. What is _not_ modeled is halation's dependence on beam
  current: real glass scatter blooms disproportionately on peak whites, so
  keying the halo radius off local luma would read more like an old tube than
  the current fixed-radius ring.

## Patching into other apps (Max/MSP, Jitter, TouchDesigner, VJ software)

Already works with no code: MIDI CC + MIDI clock in (`src/ui/midi.ts`) via a
virtual port (IAC bus / loopMIDI); audio in via a loopback device (BlackHole),
which reaches `audioBendUs` / `audioLoad` / `audioIre`; Jitter output in as a
webcam through a Syphon→virtual-camera bridge; and output back out by pointing
an OBS browser source at the page. The gaps below are what would make it feel
like a patchable module rather than a coincidence.

- **Screen capture as a source mode.** `getDisplayMedia` is unused. Picking a
  Jitter/TouchDesigner window directly removes the Syphon→virtual-cam hop
  entirely. Smallest change with the largest practical payoff — `useEngine`
  already handles a `MediaStream` source, so it is mostly a new entry in
  `sources/modes.ts` plus a picker.
- **OSC control, via a local WebSocket bridge.** Browsers can't speak UDP, so
  this needs a small node process doing OSC↔WebSocket. Worth it because
  `DEFAULT_CONTROLS` is already a flat named record and `useMidi` already
  funnels every store-origin change through one `writeControl(key, value)`:
  a bridge lets Max address `/hHold`, `/scDetuneKHz`, `/bendUs` by name, with
  float precision and no 128-control CC ceiling. The app side is a thin client
  that validates the key against `ControlKey` and calls the existing write path.
- **Bidirectional state.** Same channel in reverse — emit control changes so a
  Max patch's UI tracks the app (and so presets/scenes can be recalled from
  outside). Needs a loop guard on the write path.
- **MIDI note / program-change → scene recall.** Scenes and presets exist
  (`useScenes.ts`, `presets.ts`) but are mouse-only; note-on or PC is the
  natural performance trigger and reuses the MIDI input already open.
- **MIDI transport, not just clock.** `midi.ts` handles `0xF8`/`0xFC`; honouring
  `0xFA` start / `0xFB` continue would let clock-locked rates reset phase on
  downbeat instead of free-running from whenever the tick stream began.
- **Live low-latency output.** WebRTC to a local peer, or NDI via a native
  helper, for feeding the result back into Jitter without the OBS round-trip.
  Meaningfully more work than the rest of this list; only worth it for
  performance use.

Note for anyone evaluating the reverse arrangement: Max's `jweb` embeds a web
view but is unlikely to expose WebGPU, so hosting Phosphene inside a patch
probably isn't viable — it wants to be a separate app you route into.
